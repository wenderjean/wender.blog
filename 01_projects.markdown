You can find here some of projects I've been (activelly or not) working on. I do a lot of open-source on my available time, of course, I don't have a lot of it in the last year but I do my best. :)

Below you can find the projects I've been involved with:

1. [wenderjean/checkdotenv](https://github.com/wenderjean/checkdotenv)
2. [wenderjean/sidekiq-statistic](https://github.com/wenderjean/sidekiq-statistic)
