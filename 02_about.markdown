I'm Wender, that's it ðŸ‘‹.

Sorry, let me do this properly.

My name is Wender Freese, Iâ€™m a software engineer currently living in the middle-west of Brazil. I love coding and Iâ€™ve been doing a lot of them for almost 13 years now. I started my career back in 2010 working with Java and the old Struts (a lot of xml, everywhere). Since 2016 my main focus has been Ruby and Rails along with a lot of Javascript, Cloud, Ops, and a little bit of Angular and React.

I'm employed at [Codeminer42](https://codeminer42.com) since 2016 where I've been working first as Software Engineer and, in the last few years, assuming different challenges leading other engineers and projects for different clients.
